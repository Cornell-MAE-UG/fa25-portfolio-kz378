This project involved designing a rigid lifting mechanism within a 2D design space of 150 cm by 50 cm. The objective was to maximize both the lifting height and the load capacity while adhering to strict geometric and material constraints. 

The mechanism was constructed around: 
- One rigid bar (optimized length for maximum vertical displacement) 
- Three pin supports (two mounted to the ground for stability, one for guided motion) 
- A linear actuator (selected from a commercial catalog using maximum rated force values) 

By carefully positioning the actuator and supports, the mechanism converts actuator extension into a large vertical displacement at the free end of the rigid bar. This design make sure to achieve a balance between lifting height and load capacity, while ensuring structural stability and rigidity. 

Key Features: 
- Optimized bar length to fit the 150 cm Ã— 50 cm design envelope. 
- Placement of pin supports for maximum stability and motion efficiency. 
- Selection of a high-force actuator (up to 35,810 N) to maximize weight capacity. 
- Fully rigid frame assumption ensures efficient transfer of force without losses due to deformation.

I chose the IMA55 because it has the most peak thrust.
