One of my assignments for Statics was to design a linear actuator system. The constraints on this system include a 50mm by 150 mm 2D space, and 3 pin and one bar for the system. We had to choose a linear actuator from a catalog provided. The goal was to lift the most weight at its max height. 

Under these constraints, I had to choose wether I wanted to optimize maximum weight or maximum height. Based on my selection for the linear actuator, I decided to optimize for maximum weight as the function for the design. 

My preliminary design included a roller pin on the linear actuator, designed to lift a 150 mm bar so that its max height is at 50 mm. However, because that would fail to satisfy the dimension constraints of the space, I've decided to settle on a grounded pin for the bar and acutator. 

The actuator (IMA55) produces a maximum thrust of
