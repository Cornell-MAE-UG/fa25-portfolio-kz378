My name is Kaelin Zheng, and I am a sophomore majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a strong passion for innovation and problem-solving. I am deeply interested in designing and conducting research, where I can apply my creativity and technical knowledge to make a meaningful impact. My experience with Autodesk Inventor and Revit has strengthened my design skills, allowing me to bring concepts to life and explore solutions that bridge engineering with real-world applications.
